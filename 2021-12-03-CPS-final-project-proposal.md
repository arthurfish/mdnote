Project Proposal:
 - Project Background:
   - In WKU, students sometimes feel challenged to typesetting their particular format(such as APA, MLA) essays. From my personal experience, I once wrote the content in 1 hour, but it took me half an hour to set the format by using Microsoft Word. Several of my classmates seem more miserable because they deal with both content and style one time, which decreases their efficiency. 
   - Existing solution seems not so good: Word is low-efficiently; Latex is not only difficult to learn but also anti-intuitive; Markdown avoids these problems, but it does not supply a complicated format. Finally, I came up with the idea of using HTML5 and CSS to split the content and the style.
 - Project Description:
   - Using HTML5 and CSS to split the content and the style in essay writing. And employ Java to convert the original plain-text file to APA(or MLA) format webpage. Students then open the output webpage file in their browser and print it as a PDF file. Then all works are done.
