Dear Mr. Tree Hollow, 
I am Gao Chuxuan from GE 1000-W05 course. I want to tell you something that the time goes by so rapidly, but I can't collected as enough knowledge as I expected. 

At the first time I go to university I feel like it is a good place to self-study something. When the opportunaties laids on me, I tried the best to bringing out my potential abilities. However, I don't handle the time in the most efficient.


I am looking forward to your reply! Thank you very much!

Sincerely, 
Gao Chuxuan
