Dear Mr. Tree Hollow, 
I am Gao Chuxuan from GE 1000-W05 course. I want to tell you something that the time goes by so rapidly, but I can't collected as enough knowledge as I expected. 

At the first time I go to university I feel like it is a good place to self-study something. When the opportunaties laids on me, I tried the best to bringing out my potential abilities. However, I don't handle the time in the most efficiency. It's very recline to sleep when consume my brain power, so many of the most suitable time goes by. Although now I am used to drinking coffee to keep me alive, but things seem to be more crowded. Maybe after final semaster I will try it again, but now it is imposible for me to expect the future.

Time is the most critical resource I could manage. If they just go by in vain, all the posibilities in my life will go by ether. 

These days I meet some friends who sleep just a few hours or even not sleep, which I am afraiding that I should be like thems to maximum my knowledge benefits. But I want at first try not to waste any time, if even this can't satisfy me, I will try their method for a trial. I once heard the opinion that always stay up so late will make human die, so I am not sure whether I will do like them or not.

I need time, I truely need time. I want to study programming language which is old but poetic, I want to learn to take photos or cut the videos, I even want to learn wave music in my hands. But I afaid the time will went by in vain, at the end I get nothing.

In economy field, here exists an opinion that if you put something to use in one way, it can't be use in others ways. On profession field, I also should prepare for GRE and TOEFL. My biggest problem is when I can't get enough time, I am nervous; when I have big bulk of time, I sometimes waste them by wathing video or playing game.

Can the time truely be the gift from god for me? Can I picked up all my times and put them in suitable use? Can I not regret to everything I do these days? I don't know the answer, but I will try to be the best.

I am looking forward to your reply! Thank you very much!

Sincerely, 
Gao Chuxuan
