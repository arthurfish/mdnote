Abstract (No more than 150 words)

TIF is a back-end content recommendation system kernel based on machine learning. It can be applied to not one thing. It will be like Netflix's movie recommendation if it applies to the movie field. It will be like Bilibili or Acfun's homepage anime recommendation if it applies to the anime field.

Description

Using machine learning, recommend content that features similar to the item provided. Although it is a system kernel with no GUI but CLI, the following work can fix this problem.

Goals

Provide high-quality content recommendation back-end service, using static data set to pick up similar content in the content library.

Methodology

Quantify the words in content feature by specfic algorithm, then transform every content item in to high dimension array, using vector multiplication to calculate the similarity of different item.

Expected outcome

For example, assume this TIF system applies to movie field. User enter the movie names he or she has watched, the system then output the closest movies name.

References

The system is no in developing, so it's difficult to make the exactly reference list about this program. We will complete the reference list after our developing finished.
