As a new method to passing knowledge with extra gains, EMI(English as a Medium of Instruction) gives students in non-English countries like China or Japanese a chance to get educated with English language profits. When EMI is getting more and more popular in the world, however, there are some arguement about it among instructor and learner. I will discuss three of them in the follow text, which are the the weights of content and language, the efficience of EMI and the importance about providing extra English support class.

The first disagreement from teachers and learners are the weights of content and language part. According to a investigation, some teachers who teaches EMI agree that the content presented in class is more important than the language parts, like pronounciation and the vocabulary. But nevertheless, some students have contrast opinion. They prefer language parts more than the konwledge the learn in class. As an instance, some EMI learners in Japan consider EMI as a different form of English class. I think the main reason of the different thought is based on the role they play in the education process -- Some teacher conduct EMI lessons as professional instructor, they would earn their respect by their wide and deep understanding of the knowledge, and they don't consider themselves as just language teacher. But students' thought is the target they pay extra resource to the current cource is rising their English level. So the conflict happens.

Secondly, whether provide English support lessons is important or not important? Parts of teachers agree with the opinion that EMI is the just way to do two things in one time, so the support lessons is no need to provide. By contrast, students also have the different idea. Students may want to learn in the maxmum degree, so they need English support class to make full use of EMI. By the way, a posible reason to explain the situation is that the teacher focus knowledge more than language. Language is an extra pay to teaching, so any form of addition language require is not so comfortable.

The teaching materials is also in discussing in instructors and students. Sometime instructor think the available teaching materials is not enought, but nevertheless, students have different opinion, they think materials are enough. Some instructors' idea is that in professional field there are not so many suitable, easy for students to understanding materials can be supported. They think like that based on their pure responsiblities. But the weights of knowledge and language is contrary for students. They don't care about whether or not the knowledge they get is the leading-edge. Different from their teacher, they focus more on language, that's all.

Different roles affect the different opinion in the same thing. In general, through the dissussion, we can know that the core argument is the different focus order of "EM"(English as media) and "I"(Instruction). However, althought there are some tiny disagreements, we can imagine, with English playing more and more important role in international conmmunication, the outlook of EMI is worth looking forward to.
