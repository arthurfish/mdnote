From this OWL document, I think the main question instructor will care about to determine whether a student is plagiarism is whether or not the student uses others' ideas without obvious notation. My view of plagiarism is using not own word or idea without a claim, and if we are not aware to avoid plagiarism, it may be very easy to appear. OWL document noticed that using internet articles in drafts is very inclined to be an academic offense. When I was in high school, I sometimes searched on the Internet to write essays. So I should be extremely conscientious about it.

I feel a bit of confusion about the word "common knowledge" in the document -- Maybe it just comes from my misunderstanding. At the beginning of the first university term, our academic vice president showed an example of not intentionally plagiarizing. A student added a Chinese ancient philosophy's word into his essay, with quoting marks but without pointing out the author. The terms are in Tao Te Ching, which almost every Chinese knows. But academic vice president said his action could be concluded as plagiarism. From the OWL document, I think the student's behavior is just using something in the "common knowledge." Is my thought true? I don't know.
