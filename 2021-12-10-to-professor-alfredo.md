Dear Professor Alfredo:

Since I met you at the PIEP lesson at WKU, I have been deeply attracted by your charm, kind word, and cordial attitude. So when I found you are teaching ENG 1430, I felt incredibly excited and looking forward to taking your lessons so I can learn a lot from you.

However, the server panicked when I tried my best to scramble for your 1430 lessons on the Kean register system. Although that day I refreshed the web page more and more times again in the hell of desperate, it failed. When I finally entered the register page, which your course is full, I dropped into the hopeless abyss.

Can't I take your lesson next Spring? Can't I get you closer? Can't I ask you for coffee knowledge anymore? Can't we talk about your travel around the world? So I write this email and spend the rest of my fortune taking this ultimate attempt.

Although I am not an influent English speaker and writer yet, I can work harder than others. I want to be with solid language qualities to travel worldwide and have colorful memories as you did. 

Can you sign for my Application Form For Course Adjusting? If this work burdens your teaching task, I will say sorry thousands and millions of times.

If you feel troubled by my email or not convenient to overloading the lesson, please forgive my rudely bother behavior. But could I have the chance to make friends with you? To be honest, I really want to learn from you. Maybe part of the reason is that you sometimes look like my pass-away father.

Best wishes.
