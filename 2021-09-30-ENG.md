My hometown is a little city beside a river, with brush and trees living everywhere in dusty. Humans are shaped by their hometown, someone had said. Everytime I look into the deepest bottom of my heart, I alway see the shadow of my beloved city -- for its most beautiful scene, for its secret dust of history, and for its peaceful atmosphere that protects every citizen in her breast.

In my heart, my hometown has the most beautiful scene in the world. You can see mistery purple mist go across the whole wide surface of river, before sun rise. When the twilight dropped, divine glory stands above all the lovely building and city wall. Inside the dim light, sorrow but meek memories climb to your eyes. When the city show the most gentle face to its citizens, no one can easily forget it just a while.

The feeling of history alway awakes when I go through the acient street of the city. Smart predecessor has lived in the tiny city, led citizens fight for justice and freedom. Knowledgeable teenagers educated uncicilized public and join to the glorious fight for ideal. History not just about thing that die down, it is our city's public memory. I feel connected to the past people when I get throght the old place, and I feel proud to lived with such spirit of the brave. Time don't limit my life, because the history of hometown gives me a glace to see the the much wider life to me.

But what effect me most is the peaceful atmosphere enroll the whole city. Children playing on grass under in warm sunshine with pure joy, the older do practice their body relaxed and quiet. Students go for walk in rain days and thinging their life and fragile romance with a lovely translucent unbrela. Like other Chinese city, loneliness is considered as elegance not unsafe behave. Ralation between neighborhood is also laudable in my hometown city. Sometiems you will hear your neighbour knock your door and then they present a bowl of hot dumpling to you when they cook that. Like acient book writed, door need not to close because their are no theif. I enjoy the peacful atmosphere city provided to me, and want to say 'thanks' to all of the friendly citizens.

This is a sketch to my hometown. I do love it, without need to say more. At the beggining, I mentioned people always be shaped by his hometown. I feel gratitude to the virtue it gives me, and feel ashame to the not good aspect that I should do better. Hometown forever exists in my dream, I alway remember, the most beautiful sence it provided to me, the connection of history it gives me, and the peaceful atmosphere around me. Thank you my city, Xiangyang.
