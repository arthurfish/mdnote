I think Xbox controler is the best physical design in my life. When I play games with Xbox controler, every finger can send command to the game, it is usable. And this controler need not you learn any specific language to manuplate it because the keys' position determind what it do, and this is equitable. It's usage is offering happiness, so it need not to do something to be joyfull except change colors. This controler even makes me relaxing when I turning pages on iPad, so it is extremely usefull.
