I think Xbox controler is the best physical design in my life. When I play games with Xbox controler, every finger can send command to the game, it is usable. And this controler need not you learn any specific language to manuplate it because the keys' position determind what it do, and this is equitable. It's usage is offering happiness, so it need not to do something to be joyfull except change colors. This controler even makes me relaxing when I turning pages on iPad, so it is extremely usefull.

Goals for UX design

My goals for learning UX design is want to build beautiful website and applications without using inappropriate templates. And I also want to practice my front-end skills by design amazing website. I pursue this professional certificate is to remind myself I can't stop studying in university.

 - Have you participated in a design sprint or a similar work process before? If so, what was your experience like?

 - Were there positive outcomes of the design sprint, or ways the process could have been improved?

 - If you haven’t participated in a similar work process, what are your thoughts on the design sprint process outlined in this course?

 - Are there any phases or aspects of design sprints that seem difficult to understand or complete?

I have not participated in any design sprint. However, I joined a Hackson Programming Competition. I developed and deployed a Wikipedia-like website. I think design sprints can increase the speed of design, if there are similar competitions held on in my city, I will participate in willing.

The Ideal phrase seems to be difficult in the design sprint. Because other procedures can be only conducted by UX designers. However, the ideal phrase involves all the team members. If we can't complete this phrase efficiently and correctly, maybe the progress will go forward slowly.

Question 1
Think of a project or activity you completed with at least one other person. Spend some time writing down the responses to these questions:

 - What did you plan to do together?

 - What went well?

 - What could have been improved?

 - What would you do differently next time?

We planned to build a website that can publish individual experiences in our university as wiki items.

We successfully build the website with other's templates. And we divided the jobs in the right way so that no one's efforts are in vain.

We can work more efficiently on the development phase, and we can split the work more clearly and specifically.

I will spend more time on management instead of only developing the website singly.

# How Design Sprints Boast Group Work Experience

I once tried to build a website like Wikipedia with my groupmates. However, by my lack of experience, I don't know how to assign tasks to everyone, so I have to do it by myself. Today after I have learned the design sprints, I will do design sprints first before all the development procedures. I will let everyone understand the problem we should solve, and the ways including developing a website to achieve this goal, then prototyping and testing to put the university's needs at the center place. In that experience, we don't make prototypes so we ended up building an error-prone system.

# Share your experience of user research

- How would you have conducted this research?

- Is there anything the company could have done to make the research experience better when you were a participant?

- How did you feel about participating in this research? Did you feel heard and understood?

In Chinese, people including me always use shared bikes to transport in the city. One of the sharing bike brands is the DiDi bike. One day when I finished riding in its mobile app, it jumped a question: "Does the brake work well during you riding?". And there are five emojis from sorrow to smile to let me select. I think this form of survey amused me and does not disturb me in my daily life, is a pretty good form to conduct the survey. Because of the huge amount of its users in China, I think this one problem survey form is not only effective but also user-friendly. I love this type of survey!

# How to reduce research bias in user research
Recognizing bias is an important part of UX research and UX design in general. It’s also important to take preventive measures to reduce the influence of biases on your own research. Consider the following questions in the discussion forum:

- What are some ways to reduce the influence of bias when conducting user research?

- What could researchers do to further reduce the bias in their research?

- How do you plan to reduce bias in your own UX research?

Maybe I am lost in so many different kinds of bias. So I will try to be a monk when I am conducting research. I should care every race with people and someone easy to be ignored. Can the religious awareness help in the research without bias? To achieve this goal I should be a saint. To reduce the bias, I think I will ask my colleagues to help me reflex on my mistakes about bias when I doing research. Maybe I will also try to define the people I will not survey explicit to avoid implicit bais.
