Awareness of structure powerfully helps me achieve the goal
    -- The reflexive statement for ENG 1430 course

In the 2022's cool Spring, I attend WKU(Wenzhou-Kean University)'s ENG 1430 course to learn how to write better English essays. This course occupied about six credits in my class schedule, which means I have to perform pretty well on this course to get an expected GPA. However, my English fundamental is not good. During primary, middle, and high school, I have no interest in learning a language that seemed will not be spoken forever. Until I finally decided to go abroad, I just realized how short-sight I was before. I only can type some short sentences as fluently as I can, how can I finish a such big essay of about 1000 to 1500 words? Cold sweat dropped down from the forehead. I don't know how to achieve such an incredible goal. If there are no solutions, I will sink into the pressure ocean. Fortunately, I ended up surmounting these difficulties through the awareness of structure.

Our instructor helped us complete the writing mission by spending lots of time on the organization of essays. Our instructor Mrs. Natasha, a beautiful and caring woman, explained the essay's structure as specific as she can before starting writing. After her detailed instruction, we got to know what we should put into the first paragraph, and the important stable structure constructed by topic sentence, explanation, and supported evidence. When to begin essay writing, we were surprised by the magic of the word our professor just spoke. Previous loss and powerlessness when facing the big essay disappeared, and words and sentences flowed like a tidewater influx in the morning. My hidden creativity and eagerness to compose seemed to be summoned out. The impossible mission -- composing such a 1500 words essay, completed by organization and structure.

What a huge help the awareness of structure provided! When I am in middle school, my Chinese teachers always let me do article writing. However, they didn't give me explicit instructions to follow, and I should try to find the structure by myself. You can't understand how hopeless and hard I was when I tried to generate tens or hundreds of terrible sentences without the awareness of structure. Those days I consider writing the same word as anxiety and pressure. Maybe it was because my teachers thought their students are smart enough or we were native Chinese students so they didn't have to tell us the knowledge about structure and organization. How will it be if I take this ENG 1430 when I struggling in the mud of writing? I have to admit that intuition plays an important role in writing. However, without rational thinking, even though I can generate some beautiful sentences luckily, it is not sustainable to write clear and understandable essays.

The awareness I learned also helps me in my major. I learned a lot in the ENG 1430 course. My sense of language improve a bit with a bundle of writing practice, I can employ the time more effectively to finish the writing assignment early, and I got to know how to critical thinking when we face confusing arguments. However, the biggest harvest for me is the awareness of architecture and structure. This awareness not only helps me in the writing field, but also in my major. My major is computer science, I need to write programs to deal with complex problems. I always clicked down code with only my intuition without a global consideration. Sometimes these codes work, but more frequently they can't. In those times, finding and fixing problems is not only time-consuming but also error-prone. After this course, I know the importance of managing the entire structure and complexity. Maybe next time, when I develop the application, I will spend more time on the structure design and architecture consideration. Thanks to this course, ENG 1430, I get to know how powerful the awareness of structure is.
