With globalization coming more and more rapidly, more and more students and educator decide to use English as medium of instruction, which called EMI to improve their international skill level. Galloway(2017) had indicated that if a student want to learn the state-of-the-art knowledge, they have to choose to learn in English. However, arguments are turning up because of different understanding of EMI among the educator and the educated. Therefore, if we look at the phenomena in a deeper sight, the mainstream disagreement is about focusing on the weights of language and the teaching content. Here will present three of the argument among instructors and students.

The first disagreement is about the tolerance of students' mother tongue. Comparing to the educated, educator have more tolerance and more support on the usage of mother tongue because they prefer English just as teaching method(Galloway, 2017) This opinion is very easy to understanding because teachers should deliver knowledge to student and language and most of them is not in charge of students' language level. However, on the contrary students don't think like this. "They viewed improving their English as the primary aim of the EMI course", Galloway emphasized that in the his online articleã€‚(How effective is English as a medium of instruction (EMI)?, 2017) Students more considered EMI as a powerful weapon more that just a way to go through the lesson and simply pass conceptions from A to B. Simply to say, the purity of spoken English looks less tolerant for students that instructors.

The second divergence of opinion is the significance of language support lessons. In a material on the Internet, students, particularly Japanese learners, claim that they need English support lessons(Galloway, para. 2). But on the other hand, the necessary is considered not so big from the EMI teacher's perspective. Galloway points out students more prefer to be supplied support class with EMI. The reason may be as the same as the first disagreement. The position of language in learners' mind is higher than instructors'. Students want to make the most use of EMI lessons, and with the lack confidence of their language level, so the support lesson seems very requisite. And similarly, teachers judge their work only buy the delivered knowledge. And a possible reason is that they considered EMI lessons is enough for the goal of language learning. 

The last collision point places on the quantity of suitable teaching material. Galloway presented that, some teachers deem that the stuff can be used in EMI lesson is not enough, at the same time students don't think so(para. 5). One of the explanation looks feasible is the teaching material should to be both enough easy to let student understand and professional to giving students enough knowledge on their profession lessons, and material fits the rule is not easy to find. However, students which prepared for EMI still consider language more that the content taught. It's easy to observe that The balance between knowledge and globalize tool is inclining more to the latter on the students' view.

However, both instructors and students all agree that EMI's language side benefits. According to Wong(2010), students in strictly English teaching environment are seem perform better that the students in a loose language environment which permitted to use their mother tongue(119). 

In conclusion, the three different type of arguments mainly exist on the trade-off of content and language tool. EMI is set for the international communication demand, not only beneficial on students' career prospect, but also good for economical increment. Although there are some different voices on the conduction of EMI lessons, it comply with the flow of globalization. With more and more practice and development, EMI will help the affected step to the bigger world.
