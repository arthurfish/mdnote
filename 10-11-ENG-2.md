About EMI, here are many different opinion between students and faculties. Based on the purpose, on the attitude of the mothertongue's usage, and on the importance of English supported lesson.

There are difference when talk about the purpose of taking EMI lessons. The students in countries such as China or Japanese agree more that EMI is set up for imporvment of student English skill in a daily way, the core meaning of EMI is rising students English level. But the idea from faculties is not like this. They think EMI is a method to deliver informations from A to B , more than just English class. The focus point in different people differnt.

The another disagreement between students and faculties is the attitude of the mothertongue. Students more considered about their English listening improvement, so they expect EMI is always use English not use instructor's mothertongue. And you may imagine, teachers focus more on the delivered knowledge than the language itself. So the argument of whether EMI is for foregin language or the lessons taken. But consider both of them is not impossible, so the disagreement may disappear later.

And the importance of English supported lesson is also in discussion. Students in Japan said they should recieve EMI lessons with English support lessons. At some points, by they are not so confident to their not high English level. Some Faculties pay less attention to the English supported lesson by the opinion that EMI is enough for students to learn language. And not need to say that the efficient of EMI is depends. So sometimes the importance of supported lessons is variable.
