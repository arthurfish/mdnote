British actress Emma Watson delivered a speech at the UN in New York City on September 20, 2014, speaking as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women to launch a campaign titled HeForShe. She put out her target of involving more people to attend this campaign first. After this, she tried to change the public's negative meaning of feminism by emphasizing the definition, essence, and target of feminism with her early experience of sexual discrimination. To go one step further in destigmatizing the word "feminism," she displayed the "inadvertent feminists" in people's daily life to show the original meaning of feminism. In the remaining part, Watson introduced the amazing fact that not only women but also men need sexual equality. Finally, she appealed to audiences to take action instantly by attending the "HeForShe" campaign. Watson successfully challenges the negative meaning of "feminism" by emotionally clarifying the definition of feminist and also successfully appealed to men to attend a feminism campaign by logically explaining what benefits they can obtain from sexual equality.

Watson is a famous, successful, and wealthy actress in the British. She once acted in the Harry Potter film series, making her famous enough for western audiences. Besides, Watson is also an activist for female rights. Although she is such a shining and amazing woman, she also encounters sexual inequality phenomenon in her life. For the speech's audience, the direct audience is powerful and well-educated elites worldwide. Many of them were working in the political field and owning magnitude influence. The indirect audience is worldwide people who listen to this speech on TV or records, regardless of their countries, language, and species. For this reason, the speaker also made the lecture enough touching and understandable. From today's perspective, the campaign "Me Too" happened a few years later after this speech, and awareness of women's rights was not awake at that time. The speaker Watson made this speech to appeal to women's rights worldwide and launch a campaign to achieve this goal. She also needed to change the wrong understanding of "feminism" left on the public and tried to appeal to men to be involved in this activity.

Watson does not use too much personal ethos for appealing. The only part she mentions her identity is about her Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women, which is more like a working position rather than .social status. She didn't tell her achievement as a successful actress or her magnitude of influence. That seems surprising in a speech. However, it can be easily understood by who she represented. Watson spoke for all the women around the world, regardless of whether they were poor or wealthy, actress or cleaner. What truly touches us is not the individuality of the actress but the universal feeling and thinking of living as a woman. For the purpose of speaking for woman's rights, the speaker should pay more attention to universality rather than individuality. Another reason she didn't present her personal ethos is that she is famous enough to make herself persuasive. In the situation to appeal to humans to do something for half of the humans, using logic and pathos is more powerful than a person's ethos. It is easy to figure out that, in such cases, the audience does not care much about who you are. Instead, they care more about the reason why they should do that.

Watson employed pathos successfully to solve the crisis of the negative meaning of the word "feminist" by presenting her own experience of the "inadvertent feminist". Being stigma is the constant situation rights fighters get in. During those days of the speech and even today, feminists also are considered as man-hating, and this is a great barrier lying down the way of pursuing sexual equality. If Watson can't change humans' minds of the bad expression of feminists, the campaign will face lots of resistance. Watson solves this problem wisely by mentioning the "inadvertent feminist" in our daily life. Parents who pet daughter equally as son, school which doesn't limit girl's development by their gender, mentors who don't think girls is useless one day for their kids' birth, all are "inadvertent feminist". The speaker built the bridge between the word "feminist" and the meaning of love, help, and caring. The effect of these words is, that even the man who has an extreme bias toward the word "feminist",  they can't throw the malicious to the caring parents, to the devoting mentors, or to the impartial school manager. Emotional words and examples make her opinion easier to be accepted. Watson finally successfully erased the negative expression of the word feminist by placing ethos examples.

Only ethos and pathos can't produce strong motivation for humans to be involved into sexual equality campaigns. Logos are needed, too. We have agreed with the fact that humans are selfish animals; it seems if women's rights are more, man's rights are less. Many of man will say, "All right, but what can I obtain from the campaign?". Feminism seems very inclined to hurt men's current benefits, which makes it dangerous and harmful for men to be involved in the campaign. If the speaker wants to gather more people to take part in the campaign, she should tell all of the audience what they will get. It is obvious women will get rights and better life, but how about men? The speaker Watson employed logos about what men can obtain to make her opinion persuasive and stronger. According to the speaker, men will never need to be aggressive in seeking for identity; men will never be afraid to be sensitive; men will never need to be afraid to seek help. These logical sequences of sexual equality truly seem beneficial to men. Watson using logical analysis, presents the need for men to take action, successfully persuading half of the humans to devote their effort and making the equality spirWatson composed her speech of wise proportion of ethos, pathos, and logos, built a solid and persuasive appeal to people worldwide. Indifferent people may be touched by her emotional words; selfish people may be changed by the explicit logical consequence of sexual equality. Thousands or millions of people were driven to involve in the campaign by her passionate speech. If we analyze her speech content, we can find the reason for the persuasive in detail: the speaker emphasizes the universality problem instead of her personal achievement to pursue empathy from her audience; places familiar, loving, and daily examples with emotional expression to get rid of the wrong meaning of "feminist."; and demonstrates the possible benefits for men of sexual equality by logical analysis, earn the support of the critical half of human to making change. Watson's speech shows the inexorable trend of sexual equality and displays the women's sense of responsibility on the international stage, providing us a good example of how to appeal to the ones whose benefits are possibly hurt by a campaign.t convinced and persuasive.
