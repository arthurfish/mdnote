Hello everyone, I am Arthur, another teammate in Group 2. Margret presented her design of the WKU community. Now I will present what I have realized in this project. This realization is about our thinking procedure and computation procedure. I have built another class with Chinese and want to express literature meanings through the Java programming language. After I finished, I find the result is pretty surprise me. Java, one kind of specific calculation-oriented language, can express daily sentences so well. Although there exist few dull symbols and unwelcomed extra words, Java represents the structure of Subject Verb Object fluently. Not only plain statements but also some rhetorical sentences. (...)

After I wrote this Java code down, I found an interesting fact. Which is, that there exists a relationship between our daily rhetoric and computation. What is it? We can use for loop in code to exaggerate something, reassignment specific objects to abstract references to symbolize something. And using the wrapper function to implement action decorating. You can imagine a function swallowing a fish touching function and throwing up a hard-working fish touching function. The most important and surprising thing is, that our daily speech and thinking can be intuitively substituted by calculation. In other words, humans' thinking procedure may be a higher representation of computation. This is my main idea.

Programming languages are abstract representations and modeling of the world and problems. So do the natural language when we use it in thinking. Thinking and calculation have so tied relations on this same origin. In this final project, I modeled the WKU community by the relations between classes in Java, in the computer memory, this relation is calculated in binary. We can be sure about it is reasonable to analogy thinking as another form of calculation.

Since I found the tie relation between our thinking procedure and computation in this final project, can we accelerate our thinking like computation? I once heard some boasting skills like paralyzation or vectorization, can they be applied to our thinking procedure? I can't imagine when I think about the religious, God, Allah, Budda be put in a vector to think of once. However, honestly speaking, I believe if there exists a God, he or she would think of all kinds of crimes and kindness in two vectors like this.

Thanks so much.
