The Guardian has posted an article about the danger of driverless technics taking the place of truck drivers. The author demonstrated that, cutting-edge companies are developing competitive products which will ruin human workers' lives. And it even not the worst, the trend is also inexorable by the world-wide business competition. Another support driverless technics' evidence is that human drivers truly bring about lots of accidents every year. The author also tried to figure out the final scene of the slaughter innovation has done to the human work position. If the truck driver is sacked, it's not long for other places to disappear, like lawyers, accountants, and bankers. At the end of the post, the author appealed that both the private and public do something to compensate for humans' loss from innovation's competition.

First of all, I agree with the author's opinion that the innovations will make crisis not only on truck drivers but also on other positions that may need more intelligence than truck drivers, like lawyers or accountants. I majored in computer science, and just about a month ago, I saw the news that Google is developing a robot that can write programs automatically. I feel worried about the probability of beating the robot in algorithm competitions and building a better system than it. Technics truly shaped us, but will it destroy us? I am not sure, feeling nervous like the post's author.

But I don't think AI technology will be so powerful that it can get rid of more intelligent working positions. First of all, if the super system is exactly here, the complexity may be out of our imagination. It will be tough to understand it and even modify it. Second, it is also more difficult to determine the responsibilities of machines than humans. Human misconduct is corrected by law, but what about machines' mistakes? If a robot lawyer's mistake causes human death, how do we punish the wrong behavior? Technics can just solve one aspect of the problem, but the problem sometimes has several aspects; we can't assert all the human work position can be replaced by innovations.

I also have a different opinion about the view that innovation such as driverless vehicles will ruin humans' lives. If we open the history book, you will see lots of damage are caused by the lack of knowledge, crash between civilization, religious difference, poverty, and populism. In today's world, technics is considered a communication tool more than a disagreement maker. Technics also raise the human's position by raising the position of intelligence. If the technics are disposited for their imaginary harmful effects, we will fall into much bigger damage than just part of us should change the job. Maybe innovation does have negative parts; it still can't be measured to the human inside darkness.
