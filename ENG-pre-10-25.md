I would begin by looking at the reference style index on  p. 645. For  Hyland, I 
would find the style for a Journal Article. The model and information for writing references for articles and journals is on p. 649 Hyland's article is also published online I would also look at p. 657.

For the Bedford Handbook, I would begin by looking at the reference style index on  p. 645. As the Bedford Handbook is a published book, I would look at p. 652. But as the Bedford Handbook has 2 authors, I would also look at p. 647, etc.
