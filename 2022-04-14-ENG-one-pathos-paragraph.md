Watson placed pathos on her own experience to demonstrate the dilemma today's women are trapped in. In the speech, she showed the audience her personal observation about the daily situations regarding women's rights: She was accused by "bossy" for their directing work in the group, but the boys were not; She was sexualized by some elements of the social medium; Some of her friends stopped doing sports to keep their body probably to fit the male gaze. And not only are girls influenced by sexual inequality, but men are also. Some of the speaker's male friends feared expressing their feelings -- according to the speaker's the following opinion, maybe the reason is that they feared behaving like a woman. The feelings about the confusion of being accused of being "bossy," Anxiety of "muscle" body, and fear of being considered a woman, are far more vivid than the plain statement "Sexual inequality has bad consequences." The speaker used these pathos examples to make her speech more infectious, left a more impressive demonstration in the audience's heart, and drove their sympathy to the issue that today's women face. Watson uses pathos in this place, emphasizing the inequality effect is common and everywhere, preparing for the following appeal for women's rights.
