Firt of all, I should asked the question that whether I am a procrastination or not. So now I examine myself: I seldom postpone my homework in university since term open, it's inclined to feel proud for me. But in the opposite side, I always put off some important thing I think I should do in plans made in past days, such as learning Japaness, remembering word to pass the GRE exam, and cecite acient poems. It's ashamed to tell you I am not conducted them in the most of times. In this point, I should agree that I am truly a procrastination.
I think the procrastination without a deadline is very dangerous and it is very easy for people to pay enough attention on them. On a philosophy perspect, our life is constucted by series of fragments of lossing. Everyday we can feel the continuous loss, sometime unbearable. If we decide to be a procrastination, we will lose more in our short life that already loses too much. Life could be more colorful, so the procrastination without deadline not just hurt our career, but also could ruin our priceless life.
As a result that I am a procrastination and the procrastination without deadline is very dangerous and the danger is inclined to be ignored. I should take actions to make sure my time, my life should not be wasted. To achieve the goal, I come up with these ideas folow -- Try to drink enoungh quantity of coffee to keep me active all the time and have high quality study time. Sometimes I feel sleepy when fight against procrastination so I turn to Bilibili to be excited. It waste much of time! And I should make a particular schedule to maximization the useable time. When making the plan, I should not foget the limitation of us, if I get the frustration, I will not have interest to keep on plan. Maybe I can split the big bulk time for study to more little fragments to make the study time bearable, and schedule some sleep time to get enough spirit. Management means plan, but if plan can't be folow, it meaning lost.
