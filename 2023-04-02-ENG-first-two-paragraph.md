British actress Emma Watson delivered a speech at the UN in New York City on September 20, 2014, speaking as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women to launch a campaign titled HeForShe. She put out her target of involving more people to attend this campaign first. After this, she tried to change the public's negative meaning of feminism by emphasizing the definition, essence, and target of feminism with her early experience of sexual discrimination. To go one step further in destigmatizing the word "feminism," she displayed the "inadvertent feminists" in people's daily life to show the original meaning of feminism. In the remaining part, Watson introduced the amazing fact that not only women but also men need sexual equality. Finally, she appealed to audiences to take action instantly by attending the "HeForShe" campaign. Watson successfully challenges the negative meaning of "feminism" by emotionally clarifying the definition of feminist and also successfully appealed to men to attend a feminism campaign by logically explaining what benefits they can obtain from sexual equality.

For the speech's audience, the direct audience is powerful and well-educated elites worldwide. Many of them were working in the political field and owning magnitude influence.
