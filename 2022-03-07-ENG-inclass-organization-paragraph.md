Learning environments have two main types: learning in-person and learning online. The two kinds of environments have some aspects different. And there are at least two main differences between the two. First of all, for the immersion of learning, learning in-person can make students more concentrated on the teaching content. In contrast, learning online has a high probability that students will feel distracted. But for the topic of education equality, learning online seems it can help students who are in underdeveloped areas to access high-quality educational resources, which learning in-person can't break out the barrier of unbalanced development. However, the two unliked environments have the same requirement for their learners: learners should have the interest and frim mind to learning teaching content and think problems clearly and actively. Although the two learning environments are different, the spirit of study is the same.
