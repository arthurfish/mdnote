Huawei's productions  have a interesting function called "Space Touching Technology", which can let users control playback progress without touching screen, scroll webpages by just closing together your finger away from the phone. I think this technology well be very powerful when transplanted to PC platform. I searched hackster but not find similar project yet, but it is so interesting and I want to try that. We can use one or two infrared or LIDAR equipped on iPhone 12 Pro to trace the finger guesture and then recognize the image with PC GPU -- you can trust the computing power in PC platform. Although the technology of recognize finger gusture is challenging, it not impossible. And it has wide usage -- daily surf, convinient document reading, feeling comfortable when watching Youtube, or playing game at a better immersion.
I can make sure, if we developed this tech not bad, it will be with the power of changing world.
