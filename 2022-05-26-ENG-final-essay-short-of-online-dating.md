Shortcomings of online dating in long-term relations

Have you searched for love? Humans are social animals and persuiting love to overcome the sadness coming from lonliness. Online dating platforms are a pretty good choice to seek for love present. Its convenience and privacy make it welcoming and popular among teenagers the elders. Users upload their features and eagers on online dating platforms to search for their soulmates. An article from The Gardian (Ferguson, 2022) demostrated its characteristic as "You’re not bumping into love – you’re searching for it". Advanced Internet technology seems to provide a great bundle of advantages in dating activities, helping people more convenient to date others to build relationships. However, their potential shortcomings should not be ignored. It is quite easy to witness the advantages online dating platforms offered to develop short-term relations, but the disadvantages for these platforms to develop long-term relations, for example, conjugal relations. Online dating platforms hardly offer the opportunities to get the knowledge of the counterpart's inbeing so that the stability of long-term relations can not be guarenteed, and they also symbolize the daters so that the daters have a certain probablities to be disappointed to the couterpart's characters uploaded before.

Online dating platforms seem difficult to offer information about daters inbeings when daters searching for "soulmates". However, the inbeings from both sides is quite important to build and run a long-term relationship. In the past, if people want to build long-term relations with each other, they may be plain friends first to observe the counterpart's inbeings, such as counterpart's attitude toward families or toward work and study, counterpart's moral sense and manner on tiny position. These inbeings are helpful to thoroughly know the counterpart's characters. On the online dating platforms, even daters themselves can not know themselves thoroughly, how can one know the other's inbeings in such a short time? Text, photos, and data can only easily display hobbies, difficultly display characters, impossibly display inbeings. If someone wants to seek love in long-term relations, asking for help from online dating platforms is not a good idea.

Online dating platforms are unavoidable to symbolize the daters. For example, convert a living person to a feature vector for the convenience of comparison and retrieval, and scale their habit and interests into binary numbers. However, the real world is not only complex but also full of grey borders. In a long-term relationship, it is fatal for one side to realize the other part do not meet their expectation. Just imagine, if someone just read newspaper and pulp novels every day, why he can not descript himself as a "Literature Enthusiast"? If someone once took part in one volunteer activity, why not descript himself as "Responsible"? People always feel excited when they find others who match a set of labels, but the reality has a high probability to make them disappointed. Online dating platforms always symbolize daters as dead records, instead of living and complex humans, making long-term relationships under the shadow of unstable expectations.
