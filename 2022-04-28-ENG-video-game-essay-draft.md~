There is a widely accepted couterpoint about video games, which is people playing more video games seem more likely to be into depression. Its reason is that people who plays video games more likely to immerse theirselves in the game world, to isolated from the social, and the loneliness caused by isolation can finally cause depression. However, this opinion have at least three place of error. Firstly, if the immersion experience about playing video games can cause isolation between players and the real world, all kinds of activities with creative nature are immersing, too. Do they bring about isolation to their conductors? Do they make their conductors depressed? Second, althogh we find a positive relation between playing video game and depression from research data, we can't simply claim video games cause depression. Doesn't there exist the possibility that depressing men seek for cure from video games? Causes and effects are liable to be misunderstood. Additionally, a new technolagy withamuzing purpose is a perfect scapegoat to take responsibility for some social problem.

However, time allways proves those blames not only lacking for evidence but also short-sighted.
