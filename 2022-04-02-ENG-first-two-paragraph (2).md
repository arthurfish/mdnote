The Rhetorical Analysis Essay About Emma Watson (Final Draft)

British actress Emma Watson delivered a speech at the UN in New York City on September 20, 2014, speaking as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women to launch a campaign titled HeForShe. She put out her target of involving more people to attend this campaign first. After this, she tried to change the public's negative meaning of feminism by emphasizing the definition, essence, and target of feminism with her early experience of sexual discrimination. To go one step further in destigmatizing the word "feminism," she displayed the "inadvertent feminists" in people's daily life to show the original meaning of feminism. In the remaining part, Watson introduced the amazing fact that not only women but also men need sexual equality. Finally, she appealed to audiences to take action instantly by attending the "HeForShe" campaign. Watson successfully challenges the negative meaning of "feminism" by emotionally clarifying the definition of feminist and also successfully appealed to men to attend a feminism campaign by logically explaining what benefits they can obtain from sexual equality. In theory, men and women have no reason to refuse to participate in this "HeForShe" program. Emma's brilliant language and passionate expression deeply encouraged me to care about the sexual inequality around us, to think more about the rights belonging to humans naturally.

Watson is a famous, successful, and wealthy actress in the British. She once acted in the Harry Potter film series, making her famous enough for western audiences. Besides, Watson is also an activist for female rights. Although she is such a shining and amazing woman, she also encounters sexual inequality phenomenon in her life. For the speech's audience, the direct audience is powerful and well-educated elites worldwide. Many of them were working in the political field and owning magnitude influence. The indirect audience is worldwide people who listen to this speech on TV or records, regardless of their countries, language, and species. For this reason, the speaker also made the lecture enough touching and understandable. From today's perspective, the campaign "Me Too" happened a few years later after this speech, and awareness of women's rights was not awake at that time. The speaker Watson made this speech to appeal to women's rights worldwide and launch a campaign to achieve this goal. She also needed to change the wrong understanding of "feminism" left on the public and tried to appeal to men to be involved in this activity.

Watson does not use too much personal ethos for appealing. Although she is a successful actress, she didn't want to persuade the audience with her fame. She mentions her status only in the self-mockery words -- "Who is this Harry Potter girl?". She mentions her identity is about her Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women, which is more like a working position rather than social status. She didn't tell her achievement as a successful actress or her magnitude of influence. That seems surprising in a speech. However, it can be easily understood by who she represented. Watson spoke for all the women around the world, regardless of whether they were poor or wealthy, actress or cleaner. What truly touches us is not the individuality of the actress but the universal feeling and thinking of living as a woman. For the purpose of speaking for women's rights, the speaker should pay more attention to universality rather than individuality. Ethos usually comes from the persuasion of content and empathy expression. The statement of the speaker's achievement can only attract the audience interested in listening to the speaker's words; however, whether the audience accepts or not depends on the speech content. Insincere and posturing are inclined to exist by unwise ethos presentation. Another reason she didn't present her personal ethos is that she is famous enough to make herself persuasive. In the situation to appeal to humans to do something for half of the humans, using logic and pathos is more powerful than a person's ethos. It is easy to figure out that, in such cases, the audience does not care much about who you are. Instead, they care more about the reason why they should do that.

Watson placed pathos on her own experience to demonstrate the dilemma today's women are trapped in. In the speech, she showed the audience her personal observation about the daily situations regarding women's rights: She was accused by "bossy" for their directing work in the group, but the boys were not; She was sexualized by some elements of the social medium; Some of her friends stopped doing sports to keep their body probably to fit the male gaze. Not only are girls influenced by sexual inequality, but men are also. Some of the speaker's male friends feared expressing their feelings -- according to the speaker's opinion, maybe the reason is that they feared behaving like a woman. The feelings about the confusion of being accused of being "bossy," Anxiety of "muscle" body, and fear of being considered a woman, are far more vivid than the plain statement "Sexual inequality has bad consequences." The speaker used these pathos examples to make her speech more infectious, left a more impressive demonstration in the audience's heart, and drove their sympathy to the issue that today's women face. Emotional words and examples make her opinion easier to accept. Watson uses pathos in this place, emphasizing the inequality effect is common and everywhere, preparing for the following appeal for women's rights.

Logos are also needed to persuade people. We have agreed that humans are selfish animals; It seems that if women's rights are more, men's rights are fewer. Many men will say, "All right, but what can I obtain from the campaign?". Feminism looks pretty inclined to hurt men's current benefits, making it dangerous and harmful for men to be involved in the campaign. If the speaker wants to gather more people to participate in the campaign, she should tell all of the audience what they will get. Obviously, women will get rights and a better life, but how about men? The speaker Watson employed logos about what men can obtain to make her opinion persuasive and stronger. According to the speaker, men will never need to be aggressive in seeking identity; men will never be afraid to be sensitive; men will never need to be afraid to seek help. These logical sequences of sexual equality truly seem beneficial to men. The speaker made an amazing claim that men will not need to define who they are by who they are not. This claim is a big temptation for men who always suffer huge pressure in study or work but can't release it by shareing with others. Watson used logical analysis presenting the need for men to take action, successfully persuading the other half of the humans to devote their effort and make the equality spirits fill the air. Watson composed her speech of a wise proportion of ethos, pathos, and logos, building a solid and persuasive appeal to people worldwide. Indifferent people may be touched by her emotional words; selfish people may be changed by the explicit logical consequence of sexual equality. Thousands or millions of people were driven to involve in the campaign by her passionate speech. If we analyze her speech content, we can find the reason for the persuasive in detail: the speaker emphasizes the universality problem instead of her personal achievement to pursue empathy from her audience; places familiar, loving, and daily examples with emotional expression to get rid of the wrong meaning of "feminist."; and demonstrates the possible benefits for men of sexual equality by logical analysis, earn the support of the critical half of human to making change. Watson's speech shows the inexorable trend of sexual equality and displays the women's sense of responsibility on the international stage, providing us a good example of how to appeal to the ones whose benefits are possibly hurt by a campaign.t convinced and persuasive.
