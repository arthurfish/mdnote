The New York Times has published an article named "Bitcoin Was Made for This Moment. So Why Isn't It Booming?" written by Kevin Roose, a technology columnist. The author pointed out at the beginning of the post that Bitcoin is always considered as a kind of safe asset which can guard you against abusers' plunder or catastrophic war, and it can be easily predicted that if the word is in damage, the price of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin will go up rapidly. However, according to the author's observation, the prediction seems wrong in the present world. Although crises like one of the authoritarians launching invade war in European land happens, Bitcoin's price seemed fallen a bit. To figure out its reason, the author proposed these possible explanations from experts in different fields: first of all, Bitcoin can't hold its price stabilizing in the global economic system; The essence of how Bitcoin works is not easy to let the public understand; Its transaction speed is lower than expected; Bitcoin's properties such as anonymity or decentralization are inclined to get government's attention and their restrictive policy. Nevertheless, Bitcoin still plays its role in those hot pot events, like donating to the Ukraine army's and Canada's anti-vaccine protest drivers.

I agree with the explanation that Bitcoin is challenging for us to understand. Although I am majoring in computer science, the critical terms of cryptocurrency such as "Hash" or "Block" still confuse us, and they took me almost one month to understand it. Bitcoin is hosted on blockchain, another hard-to-understand thing. Nevertheless, the safety of Bitcoin is proven by horrible mathematics. If you are not a bit skilled in math, you can't get the pros and cons of Bitcoin. Honest saying, even the author myself can't get the whole picture of Bitcoin. So I deeply agree with the explanation of the article that Bitcoin is hard to understand.

However, I'm afraid I have to disagree that Bitcoin is an Internet tool that can protect you from tyrant's exploit. Bitcoin itself is just an anonymous tool in the payment field, similar to the VPN(Virtual private network) and the Internet itself. If we assert Bitcoin can protect public privacy, VPN and Internet also can protect people under tyranny. However, when we see the situation in North Korea and Egypt, we have to say those tools may don't have such a power to guard liberty against dictators. North Korean government straightly blocked global Internet access and developed "Kwangmyongmang" to brainwash nationals. The government of Egypt even doesn't allow Bitcoin trading. If anyone in Egypt provides direct or indirect help to Bitcoin trading will possibly be in prison. In conclusion, no matter how Bitcoin can protect personal assets, all is in vain if it makes someone specifically unhappy.

One of the experts in the article contended that Bitcoin couldn't be used as currency by its low transaction velocity. This reminds me of the controversial design in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not designed for safety and decentralization, not quick response. The whole Bitcoin system can now only deal 5 to 7 transactions per second, a very tiny number than Chinese Alipay can deal with 80,000 transactions per second. So it's obvious that Bitcoin is designed as a kind of digital asset rather than a payment instrument. Bitcoin is not suitable to be used as currency for its design purpose.

In conclusion, these days, Bitcoin's unexpected price fall demonstrated that: cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, can be more correctly described as mysterious digital assets rather than powerful digital currency. Firstly it can't be understood easily; then, its transaction can't be used as liberty as it claimed. In addition, its low trading velocity caused it can't be used as a payment instrument. Although these limits of Bitcoin are presented here, Bitcoin, with its decentralization soul, still inspires us another solution in today's world.
