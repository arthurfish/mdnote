Q: Which aspect of the video resonated the most with you and why?
A: The presentation show a opinion that everyone have their own box in their view. I think this idea is extremely true in our daily life. What I want to said is not the stereotype we create to identify "we" and "they", but some thinking limitation we born with. For example, we sometime blame the poor quality some high school provided but ignore millions of online study source; When we learn something in low efficient, we may not realize we can learn another type of thing; I always want to add something in my not delicious concentrated coffee, but I maybe consider drink two cups of mild coffee. That's my experience, maybe sometimes the box stereotype can reduce brain power consume, but for the both sides of critical thinking and do things effectively, we should get out of the box.

Q: Describe your worldview vs. someone else's - how are they different and or similar?
A: I just can demonstrate two major aspects about my worldview - one is that happy is most import thing is my whole life, the other is everyone can do anything except hurt other human directly. I know some people don't agree with me, because they think firstly, we live because we should take care of others, and then if everyone can do almost everything the society will be in mass, and the order will be destroyed. Although I can't agree with the second opinion, I can understand them because most of them are born in a dangerous and poor period. We should put ourselves into others' shoes.

Q: What did the speaker reveal about people's worldview?
A: Most of us have worldview not only from our intuition but also from parents' and teachers' instructor. The difference by skin color is the man-made line lying among our. Most of bias and stereotype is originating from these wrong lines. And we also have inside-heart boxes to divided "we" from the others. If we want to consider others in rationality, we should break out the boxes and realize everyone is the treasure of civilization. The bias and stereotype's fundamental is the unnatural lines and boxes constrain us.
