Reflection on Enhancing Active Listening and Inclusiveity in Diversity

In my slef-rating form from the class, I want to share there is one good behavior which helps me a lot and another item that I should try to achieve it when we are listening others. The first one is keeping eye contact with the speaker. I feel proud that I obey this rule for most of times I contact to others. Because my mother has told me to watch teachers' eyes when taking class. I think keeping eye touching to others' has three benifits that worth me to implement it. One is that can let others know you are concerned about their talking, which made them feel heppy to share more knowledge or informations to us. One is making yourself hard to lose the focus to other incoherent things that makes you time in good use. The last one is for the foriegn class, it is magically that if your look professor's face you can get more understanding to the words he or she said, and I can't explain why it like this. Above is the item I am proud to say "I achieve to it" at most of times. But there is another item I should do it but not consider it more before, this is called asking questions. It also have at least three benifits I didn't get noticed before -- asking quesions to speaker can make them feel respected because you have absorbed they opinion, and everyone want to get his or her opinion to others. Then, asking to speaker can make your standing out from other listeners. It a good choice to make good relationship to the speaker. Last but not least, asking quesions can force you to think further about the idea speaker passes to you. You know, the skill of critical thinking should sometime be practice in someplace.
I watched a video in the lesson and realize some way I can use to promote my listening skills. The most important rule I learned from the video is not saying your own opinions but say about the topic the speaker provided. From the practice, sometimes I can feel others annoy when I bring out my opinion and my practise rather than their. Human is selfish animal, so if you want to entertain your friend, you should give out some time to let their talk about themsleves. If I also want to free my mind, I could balance the length of sentences about myself. Maybe when our ages are becoming more and more, the occasion that we speak to other not for fun but for informations is more and more. On that occasions, you should entertain others before bringing something out of their mouth.
In our diversity environment of studying, admitting others' opinion's rationality is the first step to achieve diversity. And if you want to get the understanding from others' standing, you should communicate for informations. In mst of informations by speaking is most common choice. By advanced listening skills, it will be more convienence to swap different understanding from multicaltural students. In general, listen skills shape the fundament of diversity learning environment, by the way information flowing, idea shareing and etc. These are the reasons I think the important role speaking skills play in the diversity environment.
