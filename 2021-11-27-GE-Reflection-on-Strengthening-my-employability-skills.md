Reflection on Strengthening my employability skills

After ticking the table of Current Skills and Qualities, I am so ashamed to realize that too many problems lie on the road to communicating to others, task management, and dealing with myself. Then I will demonstrate the picked up five weak parts and the action I will conduct to improve myself.

In dealing with people, although I always feel proud that I don't make people feel offended, that is not enough for the success of human interaction. Firstly I should care about others more carefully. Teamwork is not the exchange of information but also the touch of each others' hearts. I will be a significant ability to widen the joy, lose the nervousness and sadness. Can I understand the deepest and most gentle position of the human heart? It may take time and effort. The next weak point I should come across is the ability to understand others' body language. The body is more honest than the mouth. Will I detect the true feeling of the talker who sits behind me, whether he is willing to hear me or not? I will try this because it can avoid unsensible offense.

From the time management point of view, I have to make a difference in two parts: one is organizing work to meet deadline and the other is I should equipped with business and financial skills. The management field has a saying that management is not only to do right things but also do things right. In other words, do things effectively and efficiently. As a rule of thumb, effective is easier than efficient. Meeting the deadline is the behavior that do things efficiently. The other item, the weak business and financial skills, gives me heavy expression in my campus experience. If I want to be a not bad study team leader, I can't just do without management skills, and if I want to take the resource in the most level of usage, I should take up some financial skills, because financial is made for allocation of resource: Finance to allocattion resource, management for achieving the goal. Learning is infinity.

Last but not the least aspect improvement is absolutely about myself. From the table of Reflection on Strengthening my employability skills, I found I have made an unbearable error: I didn't learn from mistakes. I have a habit of taking a diary almost everyday before, but I have dropped it for a long time. One of the traditional Chinese mortal rules is to reflect on yourself at least three times a day, and western authors also consider that mistakes are meaningful only if you remember them carefully. Mistakes should never be vain, I think it is correct.

Reflection helps me figure out the non-perfect aspects and make the step we improve clear and not miss the direction. I can get knowledge from textbooks and teachers, but the skill of dealing with humans needs practice.
