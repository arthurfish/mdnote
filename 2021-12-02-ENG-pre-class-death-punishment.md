Statement of Position: a common language to facilitate trade and communication seems inevitable
The Preview of Arguments: it is possible to use an official international language to ease communication amongst different ethnic or national groups
The Main Arguments:
 - an official international language would help communication between states. 
 - in an age of rampant globalization, there is no doubt that an international language would help different countries to trade with each other.
 - the use of an international official language doesnâ€™t mean that local languages will die out.

Reiteration of the Statement of Position: as the world becomes smaller the need for an official international language seems necessary and is clearly not such a bad thing. 


Statement of Position: international tourism creates tension rather than understanding between people from different cultures.
The Preview of Arguments: The growth of tourism and the numbers of people traveling to other countries for their vacations has led to debate as to whether this is beneficial. 
The Main Arguments: 
 - spending a few weeks in another country is not long enough to gain a proper understanding of an alien culture. 
 - Being a tourist in a foreign country brings with it problems that can lead to dislike of the native people.
 - Local people also often end up disliking foreigners.
Reiteration of the Statement of Position: global tourism creates misunderstanding between people from different cultures and that the differences are often a cause for conflict rather than celebration.
