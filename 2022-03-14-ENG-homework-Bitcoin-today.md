The New York Times has published an article named "Bitcoin Was Made for This Moment. So Why Isn't It Booming?" on March 11, 2022. This post is written by Kevin Roose, a technology columnist. The author pointed out that the public always considered Bitcoin as a kind of safe asset that can guard people against abusers' plunder or catastrophic war for a long time. If the assumption is true, it can be easily predicted that if the world is in damage, the price of Bitcoin will go up rapidly. However, according to the author's statement, the prediction seems wrong in the present world. Although crises like one of the authoritarians launching invade war in European land happened, Bitcoin's price seemed not to rise rapidly; in contrast, it counterintuitive fell slightly. To figure out the reason for the strange phenomenon, the author collected and proposed these possible explanations from experts in different fields: Bitcoin can not hold its price stabilizing in the global economic system; The essence of how Bitcoin works is not easy to let the public understand; Its transaction speed is lower than expected; Bitcoin's properties such as anonymity or decentralization are inclined to get government's attention and their restrictive policy. Nevertheless, the author ends the article by emphasizing that Bitcoin still plays its role in those hot point events, like donating to the Ukraine army and Canada's anti-vaccine protest drivers.

I agree with the explanation that Bitcoin is challenging for us to understand. For me, although I am majoring in computer science, the critical terms of cryptocurrency such as "Hash" or "P2P" still confuse us, which can even confuse experts. Bitcoin is implied by blockchain, which is another hard-to-understand system. Not only that, the safety of Bitcoin is proven by sophisticated mathematics. If you are not a bit skilled in math, you can not understand the pros and cons of Bitcoin. According to the statistic data from Allcot (2021), almost 98% of people did not understand the basic concept of crypto among 1000 people across US., Mexico, and Brazil. This result displayed how difficult people to understand Bitcoin. Honest saying, even I do not understand all about Bitcoin. So I deeply agree with the explanation of the Bitcoin fall in the article that Bitcoin is hard understand.

I am afraid I have to disagree with the opinion that Bitcoin is a tool that can protect you from tyrants' exploits. Bitcoin is just an anonymous tool in the payment field, similar to the Internet itself in communication fields. If we assert Bitcoin can protect public privacy, the Internet also can protect people under tyranny. However, when we see the situation in North Korea and Egypt, we have to say those tools may not have such a power to guard liberty against dictators. North Korean government brutely blocked global Internet access and developed "Kwangmyongmang" to brainwash nationals. Does the Internet help people in North Korea anyway? The government of Egypt even doesn't allow Bitcoin trading. If anyone in Egypt provides direct or indirect help to Bitcoin trading, they will possibly be under strict punishment. How Bitcoin asylum private property belongs to Egyptians? Facts prove that, no matter how Bitcoin can protect personal assets or spread liberty thoughts, all is in vain if it makes someone powerful unhappy.

One of the experts in the article contended that Bitcoin couldn't be used as currency by its extremely low transaction speed. That is true. Bitcoin is designed for safety and decentralization, not quick response. Bitcoin system processing speed is too low that the whole Bitcoin system can now only deal 5 to 7 transactions per second, significantly smaller than the Chinese payment instrument Alipay which can deal with 80,000 transactions per second. If Bitcoin is used as a payment tool, it should have the ability to deal with massive transaction data at one time. However, by Bitcoin's present performance, it's obvious that Bitcoin can't overtake the task of being a currency. Bitcoin is seems designed as a kind of digital asset rather than a payment instrument. Bitcoin is not suitable to be used as a currency system for its low trading speed.

In conclusion, today's Bitcoin's unexpected price fall revealed that: cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, can be more correctly described as digital assets rather than powerful digital currency. Firstly, because it can not be understood easily, then its myth of liberty protection is proven not true. In addition, its low trading speed caused it can not to be used as a payment instrument. However, although Bitcoin has such limitations, its decentralization and free soul still inspire us with other solutions in today's world problem.
