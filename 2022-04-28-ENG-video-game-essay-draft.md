Playing video games can enhance players' mind

Video games are also considered poison for teenagers and even for all players. In the past few years, much research about the harm video games cause to their players has been published. However, along with the growing influence of E-sports, the increasing quality of video game products, and the evidence of the curing effec of video games, we may have the responsibility to reconsider video games with a less biased perspective. This essay is aimed to demonstrate the positive effects of video games on mental health. Playing video games benefits the mental well-being of the player, for example, fighting off depression, increasing personal perseverance, and inspiring creativity.

Video games can help players fight off depression. Confidence loss, loneliness from isolation, excessive anxiety, and pressure are the common factor leading to depression. Video games can suppress or weaken these depression-causing factors. For some adventure games, players can get confidence after beating a monster that seems impossible to overcome or be more confident by the protagonist's heart-stirring story plot. Interaction with loyal teammates and friendly NPCs is an excellent complement to the real world's indifference, helping players deal with unbearable loneliness in industrial society. It is quite obvious that video games perform well in releasing daily pressure on different ways: Role-playing games(RPG) create mind flow from immersive experience; Action games set free pressure by harmlessly letting out the darkness in humanity; Rhythm games pacify souls by heartily enthusiasm playing. A post on Vice demonstrated the players of the game "Dark Souls" owed the help for fighting off depression to the game (2016). A depression patient shares his recovery experience on the Internet with the help of the video game Legend of Zelda(2019). Video games get rid of depression-leading factors implicitly and protect players from depression attacks effectively.

Playing video games can extend players' perseverance. Perseverance is a kind of rare quality in the present world. Sometimes there exists a strong positive relationship between perseverance and success. Video games usually challenge their players by stretch problems, which players always tend to fail. However, in the world of video games, temporary failures never mean permanent failure. Players can stand up again by absorbing failure experiences and do more skill practicing to achieve their goals. Most of the time, no matter how powerful the enemy is, players can defeat it by keeping on fighting, ending with an epic triumph like David conquered Goliath. Isabela Granic(2014) expressed this mechanism as "intermittent chances for large-scale success." Perseverance in the game world appears in such a procedure, and it can transfer to the real world by becoming a habit of players. Since tough hearts are in need in the current world, video games seem to become fertile fields that produce bundles of golden perseverance.

Video games can also benefit players' mental health by stimulating creativity on players. If without creativity, repetitive and boring life is maybe the most vital crisis in human mental health. It is pretty hard and also harmful for people living a sedentary life. It is unusual to obtain creative experience in the real world of a lack of choice. However, people can give full scope to creativity in the game world. Most video games allow you to make lots of decisions to continue the game. For example, turn-based games such as pokemon will let you decide a move sequence to win the battle. This is the creativity expressed in thinking and decision. Another specific kind of game, a sandbox game, offers an extremely high degree of freedom to create architecture mind. A post in Daily Mail introduces a research result about the positive relationship between the sandbox game Minecraft and the players' creativity level(2019). This type of game even employs creativity as its main selling point. Video games always make players feel free and feel creative. Creativity is such an indispensable material for constructing happy life. If someones lack it in real life, they can try to obtain it by playing video games.

There is a widely accepted counterpoint about video games, which is people playing more video games seem more likely to be into depression. Its reason is that people who play video games are more likely to immerse themselves in the game world, to be isolated from the social, and the loneliness caused by isolation can finally cause depression. However, this opinion has at least three places of error. Firstly, if the immersion experience of playing video games can cause isolation between players and the real world, all kinds of activities with creative nature are immersing, too. Do they bring about isolation in their conductors? Do they make their conductors depressed? Second, although we find a positive relation between playing video games and depression from research data, we can't simply claim video games cause depression. Doesn't there exist the possibility that depressing men seek a cure from video games? Additionally, if we split games into online games and offline games two-division, we can explicitly find how ridiculous to assert video games letting players isolated. For online games,  effective group communication is an award by team fighting. Sometimes even friends in the real world make an appointment to play online together. For offline games, playing them is more like living books. Some are living adventure novels; some are living puzzle books. Compared to plain books, video games are only more vivid and infectious in content. Reading books always cure and pacify the human heart, not hurts.

People tend to blame social problems on some scapegoat, and video games seem to be a very good target. Teachers and families are usually happy to ban the children from playing video games for some special reasons but do not even consider giving more love, caring, and accompanying to their kids. Video games do not lead to mental illness. Instead, they offer the warmth and a sense of control and security to contribute to players' mental health. That is possibly why some players behave like they can not live without video games -- can people with diabetes live without insulin? Video games help players keep mental health by fighting off depression, extending perseverance, and stimulating creativity. It never means that games are exactly perfect at all. However, it is critical to reconsider video games without bias.
