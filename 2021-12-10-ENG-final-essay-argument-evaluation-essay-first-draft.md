The improvement which EMI offers on proficiency, attitudes, and teaching content

Since EMI appeared as a phenomenon in the countries' education system that uses English as a foreign language, it has become more prevalent worldwide. One reason for its popularity is the belief that EMI can make students more qualified in English abilities, like their proficiency and attitudes in the EMI learning process. Do this belief valid? After concluding several conducted research, we can claim that this belief is almost right. EMI does improve students' English proficiency, their attitude toward English learning, and at the same time delivers teaching content efficiently.

The belief that EMI will affect students' English proficiency has proven true. However, not everyone agrees with this view. A commonly accepted argument is that EMI does not help improve students' CET-6 scores. This counter opinion is based on research (Lei & Hu), which states that for the students who do not get a high score in CET-4 test, EMI doesn't obviously help them get better grades in CET-6 test. In addition, if the students already get high grades in the CET-4 test, they are proved to have more proficiency than those who get lower grades in CET-4. From this perspective, EMI does not contribute to student's proficiency. (2014)

But the fundamental of this opposing viewpoint is not soundness. If we only judge students' English ability by their scores, it is partial and unfair. Language proficiency should be considered by students' subjective feelings of the language. Belhiah pointed out that when students were provided EMI lessons, most of them thought EMI had promoted their four language skills - listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Also, some of the faculty also approved that students' English proficiency is improved by EMI lessons. From these two perspectives, we can claim that EMI does promote students' proficiency.

EMI exactly helps with students' attitudes toward English learning. Some people don't think so because it's possible that students who agree with EMI's significance had positive attitudes (Lei & Hu). Lei and Hu's research also shows the potential probability that students have positive attitudes when they have high English proficiency. Nor was that all; some students reported that EMI burdens their study and secondly get more anxiety about the application of English in lessons. So by these perspectives, EMI don't contribute to the development of students' attitudes.

However, the first argument is not about the student who doesn't perform well but considers EMI as a tool to improve English. And the second can't be the evidence against EMI benefits - STEM subjects also burden students' study, why not stop them from beating students' attitudes? According to Belhiah and Elhami's work, many students benefit from the requirement to speak in public or make presentations toward classmates. Not only that, but EMI also helps students understand and interact with native English speakers more easily, providing opportunities to their language speaking skills on campus (2015). Rogier has noted the students get more confidence in using English (2012). Our conclusion is the belief that EMI help develop students' attitudes is correct.
