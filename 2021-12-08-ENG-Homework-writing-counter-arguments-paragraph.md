Cost is another critical consideration. Although most of the uniforms are cheaper than other fashion clothes, there is a common opposite perspective: uniforms cause an extra expense on families. As an example, a parent of a third grader told Education World : "My son's an unusual size, so it's hard to find him clothes anyway. Limiting what I buy to certain colors makes shopping for him... more expensive."(Chaika, 1999) However, This opinion is not correct exactly. Chaika also says that parents can reduce their financial burden when their children are limited to wearing one simple outfit every day. A piece of typical evidence is based on the National Association of Elementary School Principals' servey, 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be 150 dollars or less. The wide usage of uniform not increase the paid of the family. In contrast, lower the total clothes expenses.
