I don't agree with the statement that students will learn much more effectively if teachers assign collaborative projects rather than independent tasks. To start with, if we define effectively as practicing students' ability to the maximum extent, collaborative projects are difficult to satisfy this requirement. Secondly, if students have not learned how to communicate properly and efficiently. Finally, although there exists the probability that collaborative projects can make learning procedures much more effective, to a large extent, it exactly depends on the specific learning subject.

Cooperative projects can not help students practice their professional skills to the full extent. Usually, in a collaborative project, each participant just does their own work rather than takes part in all the work. This fact sometimes makes it teammates difficult to have an entire experience in practicing. Nevertheless, In the real world, the global view is a much-treasured ability. If we defined "effectively" as practice abilities maximally, collaborative projects are difficult to achieve this goal.

The success of collaborative projects deeply depends on high-quality communication among the participants. If this premise does not exist, it is hard to "learn effectively" in collaborative projects. However, in practice, it is common that instructors do not explicitly emphasize communication key points, and because of poor communication knowledge,  teamwork degenerates into a composition of someone's hard work and others' goofing. Could this situation be described as "much more effectively"?

Although if we admit it exists the probability that collaborative projects can be much more effective, exactly depends on the specific situation. For example, a collaborative programming project sometimes can increase the student's ability to demand descriptions, time management or project management. But what if a plain collaborative English examination paper is full of grammar completion problems? What about a cooperation task about brewing a cup of scented tea? It actually exists some situations that can be conducted better independently than cooperatively.

Generally, I don't agree with the statement that assigning teamwork to students is always more effective than the independent task. However, the value of collaborative tasks is pretty much more cherished than "effectively". Students can gradually learn how to collaborate with others, how to cut off the big task into little parts, how to be better teammates in future work. Although collaborative tasks are not effective, they are indispensable in the various stages of education.
