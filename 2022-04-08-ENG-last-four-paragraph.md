Watson doesn't use too much personal ethos for appealing. The only part she mentions her identity is about her Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women, which is more like a working position rather than .social status. She didn't tell her achievement as a successful actress or her magnitude of influence. That seems surprising in a speech. However, it can be easily understood by who she represented. Watson spoke for all the women around the world, regardless of whether they were poor or wealthy, actress or cleaner. What truly touches us is not the individuality of the actress but the universal feeling and thinking of living as a woman. For the purpose of speaking for woman's rights, the speaker should pay more attention to universality rather than individuality. Another reason she didn't present her personal ethos is that she is famous enough to make herself persuasive. In the situation to appeal to humans to do something for half of the humans, using logic and pathos is more powerful than a person's ethos. It is easy to figure out that, in such cases, the audience does not care much about who you are. Instead, they care more about the reason why they should do that.

Watson composed her speech of wise proportion of ethos, pathos, and logos, built a solid and persuasive appeal to people worldwide. Indifferent people may be touched by her emotional words; selfish people may be changed by the explicit logical consequence of sexual equality. Thousands or millions of people were driven to involve in the campaign by her passionate speech. If we analyze her speech content, we can find the reason for the persuasive in detail: the speaker emphasizes the universality problem instead of her personal achievement to pursue empathy from her audience; places familiar, loving, and daily examples with emotional expression to get rid of the wrong meaning of "feminist."; and demonstrates the possible benefits for men of sexual equality by logical analysis, earn the support of the critical half of human to making change. Watson's speech shows the inexorable trend of sexual equality and displays the women's sense of responsibility on the international stage, providing us a good example of how to appeal to the ones whose benefits are possibly hurt by a campaign.
